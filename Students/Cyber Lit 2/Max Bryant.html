<h1>My Interests in Computer Science</h1>

<div id="introduction of interests">

<h2>Areas of Interest</h2>

<ul>

<li>Coding (preferably for video games)</li>
<li>Computer Engineering</li>
<li>AI Development</li>

</ul

</div>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<div id="Coding">

<div class="col-sm-11">

<p>As far as computer science goes my main interests lie in the code that makes things like video games, social media apps, smart tv's, and electronic devices in general work the way they do. I'm also very interested in building computers themselves and designing and creating computers.My last area of interest is AI Development. I think that AI in general is very interesting and freakishly dangerous but thats part of the reason I like it so much.</p>

<p>To start off I'd like to expand more on my interest of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=coding&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS839US839&oq=coding&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1951j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on">coding</a>. Coding is essential in almost all computer run electronic devices such as phones, pc's, televisions, and even cars that have electronics in them to help them run like a GPS. To me it's very interesting because to most people it's either way too complicated for them to want to understand it or how it works or they just have no interest in it because it's boring to them. As a kid I thought it was extremely complicated as well however now that I have experience with both web design code and practical functional code I can say it's just as complicated as I thought it would be but that's also part of the reason I love it. To me coding is like solving a puzzle Especially practical code. You have to try different things over and over until something fits and makes everything else come together and work. And another thing I like about it is that it's completely freelance. If I want to write a code to make a robot spin in circles I can. If I want to make it go straight or turn or go backwards or even go in a specific pattern I can.</p>

<h2>Computer Engineering</h2>

<div id="Computer Engineering">

<div class="col-sm-11">

<p>I have always been absolutely fascinated by computers and how they work so it's no wonder I got interested in the physical side of computers in the sense that I like that mechanical and electrical elements that make up the physical computer itself.</p>

<p>When I was growing up I got in trouble a lot because all I wanted to do was stay inside and play video games or get on the computer. It wasn't that I didn't like the outside I just liked computers so much more and I wanted to learn everything I could about them. I'm specifically interested in the tech that goes into designing, building, and operating gaming pc's.</p>

<h2>AI Development</h2>

<div id=AI Development>

<div class="col-sm-11">

<p>AI development is something I've always been interested in as well. As a kid I had watched tons of sci-fi movies that had an AI that turned out to be the bad guy in the movie and I always thought it was an interesting concept and I think I had realized the true dangerous nature of an AI that is given unrestricted access to the internet and the information stored on the internet.</p>

<p>As I got older I got curious about the actual process of creating and the coding of a real AI. I did a little bit of research on the topic and found out that it was actually quite a bit more interesting than I had originally thought it would be.</p>
