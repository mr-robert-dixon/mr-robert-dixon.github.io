          <p>Gram Prime is the best melee weapon so far, other than a Zaw. It has 32% crit and status chance which is the highest for both and a devastating combo. This allows for higher level content which is obviously harder, with the right build though you can shred through almost anything.</p>
          <img src= "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/0/0c/PrimeGalatine342.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20160820032103" height= "100" width= "210"/>
          <p>Galatine Prime is one of the best melee weapons as well, it has a 20% crit and status which also is an insane combo. It is able to rip through Corrupted Bombards which are pretty tough.It has a higher slash damage which allows you to rip through any enemy once slash status is produced.</p>

          <p>The Paracesis is a fairly new weapon which is specifically used to fight sentient enemies, it's the only weapon so far that goes up to level 40 as to where normal weapons go up to 30, it's very strong but isn't recommended for anything other than sentient enemies.

It's very status heavy meaning status based which allows it easy access to shred through almost any enemy. It's uniqie due to it's heavy attack which releases a disk like object inflicts status effects upon enemies.

          <h2><u>Bows</u></h2>
          <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/2/20/Dread2.png/revision/latest?cb=20180418151352" height="125" width="225"/>
          <p>Dread is an amazing bow that is dropped by the Stalker, stalker is a rogue Warframe. The bow is very strong, has a 50% crit chance which is one of the highest for any weapon in the game, it also has a 20% status chance which helps increase damage greatly.</p>
          <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/8/89/Lenz.png/revision/latest?cb=20170803215404" height="140" width="240"/>
          <p>Lenz is a unique bow, it starts out with cold and blast damage rather than the regular slash, puncture, and impact. It has very low status with 50% crit chance as well, the low status doesn't hold it back much since it has a base status damage with cold and blast damage. It's one of the best bows in the game.</p>
          <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/2/23/AsymmetricBow.png/revision/latest?cb=20150512232727" height="140" width="260"/> 
          <p>Daikyu has an extremely high 46 status chance which is insanely good, the dps is amazing on this weapon as well. The crit chance is also very good compared to a good amount of weapons, it's 34% crit chance. This weapon is most likely endgame level compared to most other primary weapons.</p>
          <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/8/82/InfCernos.png/revision/latest?cb=20160304215549" height="140" width="260"/>
          <p>Mutalist Cernos is a version of the Cernos, which has 4 versions as in the Regular Cernos, the prime variant, the rakta that's obtainable from Red Veil Syndicate, then the Mutalist Cernos. The weapon has massive amounts of potential, has a high status chance with 49% with a semi high crit chance with 15% which is not bad at all. This weapon also deals Toxic damage but once combined with the right build it can do viral which will shred through enemies extremely fast. After firing an arrow, the impact the arrow will spread poisonous contagion, this mechanic makes this weapon a monster for higher level content for AoE (Area of Effects) damage.
