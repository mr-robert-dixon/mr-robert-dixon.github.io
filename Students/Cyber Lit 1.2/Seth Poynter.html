      <h1>More About Me </h1>
      <p>I am Seth Poynter, you can call me Seth. I was born with a syndrome that caused me to be deaf at birth. I started hearing for the first time at age 1 (Early 2004). I like to do things that I enjoy, that includes making videos, pictures, mostly movies. Everytime I make something, it has a purpose, like a story for an example. I like to play video games on an occasion, mostly like to listen to music. </p>

    <div class="col-sm">
     <h1> My Pathway Plans </h1>
     <p>As of right now, I am in Cyber Literacy during my sophomore year (2018-2019). Waiting on my request to change pathways which I will take Pre-Law, spend my last 2 years in high school in Pre-Law Pathway. Then I go to college/university, then law school which is 8 years of education total. I will take my bar exam and hopefully become an Attorney.</p>
